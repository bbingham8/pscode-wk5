// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

// program to check if number is even or odd
// collect input from the user

// collect a number from the user
message prompt to collect input to set the constant

// check if the number is even
IF number MOD 2 === 0
// if the number is even, print that it is even
print number is even
// if the number is not even, print that it is odd
ELSE
print number is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

// collect numbers from the user
set five variables; each variable to contain one numbber from user via prompt
example: n1 = prompt("Enter the 1st number"); 

// calculate average of the five numbers
set avg variable to contain the sum of the five numbers divided by 5

// Determine the number with the smallest value and the number with the largest value
set a "smallest" variable to contain the smallest result of Math.min applied to the five numbers
set a "largest" variable to containt the largest result of Math.max applied to the five numbers

// display the restults to the screen
print a message to the screen to show the average number
example: "The average of the 5 numbers you entered is $avg"

print a message to the screen to show the smallest number and largest number of the five provided
example: "The smallest number you entered was $smallest"
example: "The largest number you entered was $largest"
